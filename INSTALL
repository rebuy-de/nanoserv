Installation
============

1/ First, make sure you have a recent PHP-cli binary installed in your path.
# php -v ||echo "not going to work"

2/ Then you may want to install phpDocumentor to generate the nanoserv API
documentation. If you installed PHP the right way (from sources), you can do:
# pear install phpDocumentor

3/ Now it's time to build and install nanoserv.
# ./configure && make && make install
